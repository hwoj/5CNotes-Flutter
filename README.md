# 5C Notes

The UI for the 5C Notes application developed for CS181AA at Harvey Mudd.

The contents of the application can be found in the /lib directory and the tests are found in /test. The tests are divided in to unit and widget tests folders.

All files related to file tree components and the editor (and related tests) were written by Henry along with the API consumption code. Alejandro produced login, signin, email verification, change password, topbar, and much of the settings code as well as the widget tests.

# How to run

Clone the repo to your local device. 

To build the app, you can type the command "flutter build" in the terminal.

To run the app locally, type "flutter run" in the terminal.

To test the app, type the command "flutter test" in the terminal.  This will provide details as to which tests passed and failed.  This runs all tests, including both unit and widget tests with only one command.
