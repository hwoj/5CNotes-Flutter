# 5C Notes

The UI for the 5C Notes application developed for CS181AA at Harvey Mudd.

The contents of the application can be found in the lib directory and the tests are found in /test. The tests are divided in to unit and widget tests folders.

All files related to file tree components were written by Henry along with the API consumption code. Alejandro produced login, signin, email verification, change password, topbar, and much of the settings code as well as the widget tests.
